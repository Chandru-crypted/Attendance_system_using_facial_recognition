To understand how face detection in open cv works

Github link for different xml , go to frontal face defualt.xml 
https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades

click save as in chrome and save it as a xml document 

An article about which face detector to use a very good article 
https://www.learnopencv.com/face-detection-opencv-dlib-and-deep-learning-c-python/

I tried har cascade cclassifier it did not work very well, then i thought of trying dlib detector using HOG classifiers
So it needed the dlib library to be installed it is another library like open cv 
to install that in windows u need
